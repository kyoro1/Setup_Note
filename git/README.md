# Git commands

This site includes frequently used operation in git:

## Initiation

- Cloning the repository into our local environment:
```sh
git clone git@github.com:kyoro1/Setup_Note.git
```

## Update the repository

- Add our updates in staging:
```sh
git add [Related files]
```

- Finalize our updates:
```sh
git command
```

- Insert our update into the target repository:
```sh
git push
```

## Branch
In case of adding some features, we often use branch:

- Check the branches we have locally
```sh
git branch
```

- Switch another branch

```sh
git checkout [target branch]
```

If we want to generate new branch and switch into it:

```sh
git checkout -b [new branch]
```
